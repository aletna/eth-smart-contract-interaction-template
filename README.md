# I built a basic template to connect to any smart contract (both on the ETH mainnet or any testnet)

### Get Started
1. clone Repo
2. cd into repo
3. in your terminal run `npm install`
4. start local server: `npm run dev`

Once up and running you there are 2 functions to interact with of the smart contract
`setGreeting`: Let's you store any greeting string
`callGreeting`: Retrieves the latest greeting string stored
